  #
  #  A replacement for
  #  XssTerminate[http://github.com/look/xss_terminate/tree/master],
  #  XssFoliate will strip all tags from your ActiveRecord models'
  #  string and text attributes.
  #
  #  Please read the Loofah documentation for an explanation of the
  #  different scrubbing methods, and
  #  Loofah::XssFoliate::ClassMethods for more information on the
  #  methods.
  #
  #  If you'd like to scrub all fields in all your models (and perhaps *opt-out* in specific models):
  #
  #    # config/initializers/loofah.rb
  #    require 'loofah-activerecord'
  #    Loofah::XssFoliate.xss_foliate_all_models
  #
  #    # db/schema.rb
  #    create_table "posts" do |t|
  #      t.string  "title"
  #      t.text    "body"
  #      t.string  "author"
  #    end
  #
  #    # app/model/post.rb
  #    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #      #  by default, title, body and author will all be scrubbed down to their inner text
  #    end
  #
  #  OR
  #
  #    # app/model/post.rb
  #    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #      xss_foliate :except => :author  # opt-out of sanitizing author
  #    end
  #
  #  OR
  #
  #      xss_foliate :strip => [:title, body]  # strip unsafe tags from both title and body
  #
  #  OR
  #
  #      xss_foliate :except => :title         # scrub body and author but not title
  #
  #  OR
  #
  #      # remove all tags from title, remove unsafe tags from body
  #      xss_foliate :sanitize => :title, :scrub => :body
  #
  #  OR
  #
  #      # old xss_terminate code will work if you s/_terminate/_foliate/
  #      # was: xss_terminate :except => [:title], :sanitize => [:body]
  #      xss_foliate :except => [:title], :sanitize => [:body]
  #
  #  OR
  #
  #      # when the final content is intended for non-html contexts,
  #      # such as plaintext email, you can turn off entity encoding
  #      # for all fields
  #      xss_foliate :encode_special_chars => false   # do *not* escape HTML entities in any field. NOTE THAT THE RESULT IS UNSAFE FOR RENDERING IN HTML CONTEXTS.
  #
  #  OR
  #
  #      # or you can turn off entity encoding only for specific fields.
  #      xss_foliate :unencode_special_chars => [:title]  # will escape HTML entities in all fields except title. NOTE THAT `TITLE` IS UNSAFE FOR RENDERING IN HTML CONTEXTS.
  #
  #
  #  Alternatively, if you would like to *opt-in* to the models and attributes that are sanitized:
  #
  #    # config/initializers/loofah.rb
  #    require 'loofah-activerecord'
  #    ## note omission of call to Loofah::XssFoliate.xss_foliate_all_models
  #
  #    # db/schema.rb
  #    create_table "posts" do |t|
  #      t.string  "title"
  #      t.text    "body"
  #      t.string  "author"
  #    end
  #
  #    # app/model/post.rb
  #    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  #      xss_foliate  # scrub title, body and author down to their inner text
  #    end
  #

      #  Annotate your model with this method to specify which fields
      #  you want scrubbed, and how you want them scrubbed. XssFoliate
      #  assumes all character fields are HTML fragments (as opposed to
      #  full documents, see the Loofah[http://loofah.rubyforge.org/]
      #  documentation for a full explanation of the difference).
      #
      #  Example call:
      #
      #   xss_foliate :except => :author, :strip => :body, :prune => [:title, :description]
      #
      #  *Note* that the values in the options hash can be either an
      #  array of attributes or a single attribute.
      #
      #  Options:
      #
      #   :except => [fields] # don't scrub these fields
      #   :strip  => [fields] # strip unsafe tags from these fields
      #   :escape => [fields] # escape unsafe tags from these fields
      #   :prune  => [fields] # prune unsafe tags and subtrees from these fields
      #   :text   => [fields] # remove everything except the inner text from these fields
      #
